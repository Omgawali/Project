    Customised Database Management System:
    Technology: C Programming
    Description: 
        * This project provides the emulation of all the facilities and functionalities provided by the Database Management System. 
        * For emulation purpose we create parser to parse the SQL queries.
        * Each query gets handled explicitly with all constraints and aggregate functions.
        * We provide our own customised shell to interact with the customised database management system
      
    
    Generalised Data Structures Library:
    Technology: C++ Programming 
    Description:
        * This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.
        * We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data strutters in an object oriented way.
        * We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
        * All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
        

  Customised Virtual File System :
  Technology : C Programming
  Description :
        * This project provides all functionality to the User which same as Linux File System.
        * It provides necessary commands, system calls implmentations of file system through customized shell.
        * In this project we implements all necessary data structure of file system like Incore Inode Table, file table, UREA, User File descriptor table.
        * Using this project we can use every system level fuctionality of Linux operating system on any other operating system platform.
        * We provide our own customised shell to interact with the custoimised database management system.
   
   
   File Packer-Unpacker :
   Technology : Java Programming
   Description :
        * This project provides the facility of packing and unpacking the regular files. 
        * In case of packing activity all the data of multiple regular files get stored in single file with all related metadata.
        * In case of unpacking activity the data from the packed file gets extracted in the separate file with all necessary details.
        * We provide Graphical user interface to interact with the application.
