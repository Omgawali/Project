        Customised Database Management System:
        Technology: Java Programming
        Description: 
        * This project provides the emulation of all the facilities and functionalities provided by the Database Management System. 
        * For emulation purpose we create parser to parse the SQL queries.
        * Each query gets handled explicitly with all constraints and aggregate functions.
        * We provide our own customised shell to interact with the customised database management system
  
        Customised Virtual File System :
        Technology : C Programming
        Description :
        * This project provides all functionality to the User which same as Linux File System.
        * It provides necessary commands, system calls implmentations of file system through customized shell.
        * In this project we implements all necessary data structure of file system like Incore Inode Table, file table, UREA, User File descriptor table.
        * Using this project we can use every system level fuctionality of Linux operating system on any other operating system platform.
        * We provide our own customised shell to interact with the custoimised database management system.
    
        Generalised Data Structures Library:
        Technology: C++ Programming 
        Description:
        * This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.
        * We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data strutters in an object oriented way.
        * We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
        * All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
    
        File Packer-Unpacker :
        Technology : Java Programming
        Description :
       * This project provides the facility of packing and unpacking the regular files. 
       * In case of packing activity all the data of multiple regular files get stored in single file with all related metadata.
       * In case of unpacking activity the data from the packed file gets extracted in the separate file with all necessary details.
       * We provide Graphical user interface to interact with the application.


        Periodic Process Logger with Auto Scheduled Log Report Facility
        Technology : Python Programming
        * This Project automate process log facility
        * In this project we craete log file with current time and store information about all running processes as its name, PID, memoryusage,Thread count number of child process.
        * Our automation script executes periodically depends on the time specified by user using scheduler of python
        * After periodic execution it sends the log file to the specified email address.
